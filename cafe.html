      Brown Residential College is one of UVA's few intentional residential communities, a dormitory organized around the values of creativity and academic 
        excellence and inspired by the historic residential colleges of Ivy League universities. While I was working on residence staff in Brown, 
        I noticed some deficiences in its social spaces. The architectural design consisted of towers, or "portals," connected only 
        by narrow underground tunnels. This meant that residents could not enjoy the natural social encounters that result from the hall-style 
        layout that most UVA dorms use. In addition, most of its common spaces were in the basement, cramped, and in various 
        states of disrepair. Most renovations in Brown would require extraordinary administrative oversight due to the buildings' 
        historic status as the first new dorms built since the founding of the University. Brown also faces limited University dining options, 
        even though all residents are required to purchase University meal plans.</p>
        <p>
        I wanted to do something within my limited power to help improve Brown's common spaces. In the spring of 2015, I had the 
        opportunity to visit some of Princeton University's residential colleges, and I along with the incoming president of Brown's 
        governance board were delighted and inspired by the <a href="http://religiouslife.princeton.edu/people-places/murray-dodge-caf%C3%A9">
        Murray-Dodge Café.</a> We decided something like this would be an excellent solution to both problems. 
        In the summer of 2015, I got to work with Brown College and UVA Housing administrators to make the Brown Café a reality. </p>
        <p>
        The Café opened in spring 2016 and has operated sucessfully since then, as of my latest update in spring 2017. The following 
          slide deck shows before and after photos, with paintings and mugs decorated by Brown residents and decorations installed by 
          a team of Brownies and I. The deck also features the preliminary budget proposal that I drafted for one of our key 
          adminstrators. </p>
